# Gesture-Recognition-Algorithm-using-IMU-Sensor
This project uses IMU sensor (MPU9250) data fusion with Machine Learning to implement a gesture recognition algorithm.
The codes attached are based on the Python, and C++ scripts.
A project report is also attached which contains a brief overview of the project and results.
